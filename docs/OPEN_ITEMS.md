# Open Items

- [x] Core user persona → solo indie hacker with day job

## Technical Questions
- [x] D1 row limits → 10GB free, fine for year 1

- [x] Ideabrowser.com audit → $999/yr Pro, shallow analysis, launched May 2025
- [ ] Reddit API rate limits for PRAW (waiting on API approval)
- [x] Product Hunt API → GraphQL v2, requires OAuth token
