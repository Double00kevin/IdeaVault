## [Unreleased]

### 2026-03-28 — d86b79b: Landing page redesign
- feat: redesigned landing page with animated ECG heartbeat pulse dividers (new EcgDivider.tsx React island)
- Full-page constellation background (fixed position, visible behind all sections)
- Hero section simplified — removed Live Feed Preview mockup, updated trust line to "1 free idea daily"
- Source strip simplified — removed 8 individual SVG logos, bold "SCANNING ALL SOURCES EVERY DAY" label
- New unified "Today's Idea" section: free idea card with badge, card legend (6-item grid), 10 locked title rows (first 4 visible, rest blurred), upgrade CTA box
- How It Works updated: Scrape→"Multi-Agent Research", Deliver→"Discover", updated descriptions
- Removed "Stop guessing what to build" value proposition section
- Pricing tiers updated: Free = 1 idea/day + view titles (rest disabled), Pro = all features bold
- Competitor callout updated: "Others charge $299–$999/year..."
- Footer legal links now point to /terms and /privacy
- 5 ECG dividers placed between sections (none between hero and source strip)
- Section spacing normalized (py-10 sections, my-10 dividers, transparent backgrounds)

### 2026-03-28 — c14425d: Pre-launch gates completed
- **Stripe live:** sandbox keys replaced with production keys across all three Wrangler secrets (STRIPE_SECRET_KEY, STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET, STRIPE_PRICE_ID). Live product: AIdeaPulse Pro (prod_UEQgecXm2DRu58), price: $12/mo (price_1TFxq1P3Smm2ZjICslGZI1Q7). Webhook endpoint at api.aideapulse.com/api/stripe/webhook listening for checkout.session.completed, customer.subscription.updated, customer.subscription.deleted.
- **Google OAuth published:** GCP OAuth consent screen exited Testing mode → In production. Branding page updated with home page, privacy policy (/privacy), and terms of service (/terms) URLs. No logo uploaded yet — users see "unverified app" warning until logo + verification submitted (cosmetic, not blocking).
- **Frontend redeployed:** privacy.astro and terms.astro (committed in cc4d8a8) now live on Cloudflare Pages.

### 2026-03-28 — 66da867: Apply D1 migrations in vitest test setup
- fix: integration tests in workers/test/health.test.ts failed because miniflare D1 had no tables
- added workers/test/setup.ts — applies full D1 schema via env.DB.batch() before tests run
- wired setup file into vitest.config.ts via setupFiles
- all 23 Workers tests now pass (7 fitScore + 11 ideas routes + 5 health/integration)

### 2026-03-28 — cc4d8a8: Privacy policy and terms of service pages
- feat: /privacy page — full privacy policy with all sections, CCPA/GDPR subsections, styled to match site
- feat: /terms page — full terms of service with 18 sections
- feat: BaseLayout footer updated with Privacy Policy and Terms of Service links
- feat: cross-links at bottom of each page pointing to the other
- build verified clean, both pages in output

### 2026-03-28 — 19a4db4: Deploy fixes + quick fixes batch
- deploy: Workers redeployed to production — content gating verified live (anon response strips pro fields, returns `tier: "anon"`)
- fix: pipeline webhook URL updated from workers.dev to api.aideapulse.com in pipeline/.env
- ops: systemd timer rescheduled to 23:00 Central (DST-aware via TimezoneOfTimer), service timeout increased to 18000s (5 hours)
- fix: vitest config updated to reference wrangler.jsonc instead of wrangler.toml (f0dc104)
- fix: removed localhost:8787 fallback in ideas/[id].astro — now uses /api like all other components (6285df9)
- fix: added nodejs_compat compatibility flag to wrangler.jsonc — vitest now initializes and runs (18 unit tests passing) (19a4db4)
- verified: /api/profile returns 401 for unauthenticated requests (was 404 pre-deploy)
- docs: deploy verification and quick-fix results logged to docs/testing-results/

### 2026-03-28 — 9758e8a: Stripe checkout flow verified end-to-end
- fix: Google OAuth Client Secret mismatch fixed (rotated secret in GCP, updated in Clerk SSO)
- fix: attempted @clerk/astro integration (f25b84d) — broke SSR on Cloudflare Workers, reverted (bb0bd7b, 1bd1bb1)
- fix: module-level `let clerkMounted` singleton guard broke Vite SSR bundling — reverted to original AuthProvider
- fix: ProCheckout rewritten to use `window.Clerk` global instead of own ClerkProvider — eliminates duplicate ClerkProvider error on multi-island pages (9758e8a)
- verified: Stripe test checkout flow works — click "Upgrade to Pro" → Stripe checkout → webhook fires → D1 subscriptions table updated (plan: pro, status: active)
- verified: Google OAuth sign-in working via Clerk (Testing mode, test user configured)
- note: Google OAuth app still in Testing mode — needs privacy policy + terms pages before verification/publishing
- chore: old Google Client Secret (ending ****ruAM) disabled + deleted from GCP — only ****QTIz remains (active in Clerk)

### 2026-03-27 — 469ec31: Content gating — three-tier visibility (ADR-004)
- feat: D1 migration 0006 — daily_free_claims table (user_id + claimed_date PK, idea_id, index)
- feat: server-side tier detection (anon/free/pro) via optionalAuth middleware on ideas endpoints
- feat: stripIdeaFields() — anon/free list view returns only id, title, source_type, confidence_score, created_at, build_complexity
- feat: teaserIdeaFields() — gated detail view adds one_liner for teaser
- feat: GET /api/ideas returns `tier` field + `daily_free_idea_id` for free users; Pro gets full data, free gets stripped (except daily claim), anon gets stripped
- feat: GET /api/ideas/:id — Pro full access, free first-click daily claim (auto-insert), anon teaser + signup_required
- feat: daily claim boundary at 06:00 UTC (aligned with pipeline run)
- feat: IdeaFeed always sends Authorization header, reads tier/daily_free_idea_id from response
- feat: IdeaCard three render modes — anon (title + sign-up CTA), free gated (title + score + claim/upgrade CTA with lock icon), full (unchanged)
- feat: IdeaDetailGated component — client-side re-fetch with auth for detail pages, teaser + CTA fallback
- feat: ideas/[id].astro SSR renders anon teaser for SEO/social sharing, hydrates with auth client-side
- feat: 11 vitest unit tests — stripIdeaFields, teaserIdeaFields, getClaimDate (06:00 UTC boundary, month/year edges)
- fix: stripIdeaFields corrected to return source_type + build_complexity (469ec31)
- deploy: D1 migration 0006 applied, Workers redeployed
