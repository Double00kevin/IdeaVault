## [Unreleased]

### 2026-03-27 — 469ec31: Content gating — three-tier visibility (ADR-004)
- feat: D1 migration — daily_free_claims table (user_id + claimed_date PK, idea_id, index)
- feat: server-side tier detection (anon/free/pro) via optionalAuth middleware on ideas endpoints
- feat: stripIdeaFields() — anon/free list view returns only id, title, source_type, confidence_score, created_at, build_complexity
- feat: teaserIdeaFields() — gated detail view adds one_liner for teaser
- feat: GET /api/ideas returns `tier` field + `daily_free_idea_id` for free users; Pro gets full data, free gets stripped (except daily claim), anon gets stripped
- feat: GET /api/ideas/:id — Pro full access, free first-click daily claim (auto-insert), anon teaser + signup_required
- feat: daily claim boundary at 06:00 UTC (aligned with pipeline run)
- feat: IdeaFeed always sends Authorization header (not just for Smart Match), reads tier/daily_free_idea_id from response
- feat: IdeaCard three render modes — anon (title + sign-up CTA), free gated (title + score + claim/upgrade CTA with lock icon), full (unchanged)
- feat: IdeaDetailGated component — client-side re-fetch with auth for detail pages, teaser + CTA fallback
- feat: ideas/[id].astro SSR renders anon teaser for SEO/social sharing, hydrates with auth client-side
- feat: 11 vitest unit tests — stripIdeaFields, teaserIdeaFields, getClaimDate (06:00 UTC boundary, month/year edges)
- fix: stripIdeaFields corrected to return source_type + build_complexity (was returning category, missing complexity)
- note: D1 migration 0006 pending deploy — run `npx wrangler d1 migrations apply ideavault --remote`

### 2026-03-27 — ea50e31: Smart Match — personalized idea scoring for Pro users
- feat: D1 migration — user_profiles table (skills, budget_range, niches, experience_level)
- feat: POST/GET /api/profile endpoints with Zod validation + Pro subscription gate (403 if not Pro)
- feat: fitScore scoring engine — weighted average of skill_match (35%), niche_match (25%), budget_match (20%), complexity_fit (20%)
- feat: 7 vitest unit tests for fitScore (perfect match, no match, partial, edge cases)
- feat: GET /api/ideas?smart_match=true — scores + sorts ideas by fit_score DESC for authenticated Pro users with profile
- feat: ProfileSetup modal — chip selectors for skills (19 options, max 10) and interests (16 options, max 8), radio groups for budget and experience
- feat: IdeaFeed Smart Match toggle — Pro-only button in filter bar, opens ProfileSetup if no profile exists
- feat: IdeaCard FIT badge — color-coded pill (green >= 80, amber >= 50, gray < 50) with tooltip reason
- chore: exported verifyClerkToken for direct use in route code
- chore: vitest.unit.config.ts for pure unit tests (separate from Workers pool config)
- chore: zod added to workers dependencies
