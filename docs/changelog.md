# Changelog

All notable changes to AIdeaPulse (formerly IdeaVault) will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### 2026-04-05 — Remove Anthropic API, replace with Claude Code analysis

**Architecture (breaking):**
- Removed entire Python ingestion pipeline (`pipeline/` directory archived to `pipeline-archive-2026-04-05.tar.gz`)
- Removed `systemd/` timer and service (disabled `aideapulse-pipeline.timer`)
- Removed `@anthropic-ai/sdk` from Workers
- Removed 6 Workers source files: `ingest.ts`, `validate.ts`, `actions.ts`, `generate.ts`, `ai-test.ts`, `ai-helpers.ts`
- Removed 3 frontend pages/components: `validate.astro`, `generate.astro`, `ValidateForm.tsx`, `IdeaGenerator.tsx`, `AIActions.tsx`
- Removed nav links for Validate and Generate
- Removed Env bindings: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `CF_AIG_TOKEN`, `INGEST_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

**New workflow:**
- Signal analysis now handled by Claude Code on KITT reading crawlee-research exports directly
- "Analyze crawlee exports" workflow documented in `.claude/CLAUDE.md` with full criteria (pre-filter quotas, classification, analysis schema, framework evaluation, D1 write via MCP)
- D1 MCP write path verified (insert/read/delete test)
- Manual trigger — no cron, Kevin initiates analysis sessions

**Deployed:**
- Workers redeployed (no Anthropic SDK, no AI routes)
- Frontend redeployed (no validate/generate pages, no AI actions component)

### 2026-04-01 — f1be916: Integrate crawlee-research as pipeline source #13

**Pipeline:**
- feat: `pipeline/scrapers/crawlee.py` — new scraper reads from crawlee-research SQLite database (`data/crawlee.db`) on KITT via read-only connection. `CrawleeSignal` dataclass (source, title, content, url, author, score, tags, scraped_at). Pulls last 7 days by default, excludes native AIdeaPulse sources (reddit, hackernews, github) to avoid duplicate Claude API spend. Configurable via `CRAWLEE_DB_PATH` and `CRAWLEE_EXCLUDE_SOURCES` env vars
- feat: `filter_crawlee()` in prefilter — top 15 by score
- feat: `_format_crawlee_signal()` formatter — includes crawlee source type, score, tags, content excerpt in community signal metadata
- feat: pipeline now scrapes 13 sources (12 native + crawlee)

**D1:**
- feat: migration 0013 — `source_type` CHECK constraint expanded to include `'crawlee'`, table recreated, indexes rebuilt, FTS5 index repopulated and sync triggers recreated

### 2026-03-31 — bd2e1f8: Sprint 6 Phase 6B — AI Actions + Idea Generator

**Workers (API):**
- feat: `POST /api/ideas/:id/actions` — 5 structured AI deep-dive actions per idea: market opportunity, technical feasibility, revenue model, weekend build plan, competitor landscape. Haiku model for fast/cheap responses. 24h D1 cache (skip API call if cached response exists). Rate-limited via Durable Object (free: 1/day, Pro: 30/day)
- feat: `POST /api/generate` — personalized idea generation from Smart Match profile. Loads user's skills/budget/niches/experience, top 50 ideas as dedup context (slim: title + one_liner + scores). Sonnet model. Returns 3 ideas with FIT scores. Rate-limited (free: see 1 idea + blur rest, Pro: 5/day)
- feat: `actionsHandler` and `generateHandler` route modules with auth, tier check, rate limiting, Anthropic SDK calls, error handling (429→503, 500→502, timeout→retry)

**Frontend:**
- feat: `AIActions.tsx` — Deep Dive section on idea detail with 5 action buttons (grid layout), inline result panel, loading spinners, Pro-gating on 3 actions, cached response indicator
- feat: `IdeaGenerator.tsx` — /generate page component with profile summary (skill/niche chips), generate button with loading UX, 3 idea result cards with FIT score badges, free tier blur + upgrade CTA, remaining count display
- feat: `generate.astro` — new /generate page
- feat: `IdeaCard.tsx` — wired AIActions component into expanded detail (after Framework Analysis)
- feat: nav updated with "Generate" link

**D1:**

- feat: migration 0012 — `generated_ideas` table (user_id, ideas_json, created_at) with user index

### 2026-03-31 — 1315bd3: Sprint 6 Phase 6A — Framework Analysis + Validate My Idea

**Pipeline:**
- feat: `analyze_frameworks()` — new 3rd-stage Sonnet analysis producing 4 plain-language framework scores per idea: "Is this worth building?" (Value Equation), "Who would pay and why?" (ACP), "How does this stack up?" (Value Matrix), "Where's the money?" (Value Ladder). Each framework has label, framework name, score (0-10), and 2-3 sentence explanation
- feat: `FRAMEWORKS_PROMPT` — separate focused prompt for framework analysis (keeps existing ANALYSIS_PROMPT unchanged, avoids prompt bloat)
- feat: frameworks stage wired into `_analyze_batch()` after stage 2 — only runs on ideas that pass confidence threshold

**Workers (API):**
- feat: `POST /api/validate` — "Validate My Own Idea" endpoint. User submits idea text (max 500 chars, HTML-stripped, unicode-normalized). FTS5 full-text search finds top 20 related ideas from D1. Sonnet produces SWOT analysis cross-referenced against signal database. Returns confidence score, strengths/weaknesses/opportunities/threats, matched signals, "build this weekend" next step. Rate-limited via Durable Object (free: 1/calendar month, Pro: 10/day). Content gating: free sees confidence + strengths only
- feat: `RateLimiterDO` — Durable Object for atomic per-feature rate limiting. SQLite-backed (free plan compatible). Supports daily and monthly windows. Fail-open on DO unavailability (allow + log). Replaces global rate limiter
- feat: `ai-helpers.ts` — shared utilities: `createAnthropicClient()`, `sanitizeUserInput()` (HTML strip, unicode normalize, newline collapse, length limit), `parseAIJsonResponse()` (markdown fence stripping), `getRateLimitKey()` (daily/monthly key generation)
- feat: `ideas.ts` — `frameworks_json` now parsed as array (was object), `teaserIdeaFields()` includes first framework header + score for free user teaser
- feat: `ingest.ts` — frameworks type updated to accept array format from pipeline

**Frontend:**
- feat: `FrameworkAnalysis.tsx` — collapsible "Quick Scores" section on idea detail. Pro: all 4 frameworks with expandable explanations. Free: 1st score visible, rest blurred with upgrade CTA. Color-coded scores (green 8+, amber 5-7, gray <5)
- feat: `ValidateForm.tsx` — /validate page component. Textarea with 500-char limit, character counter, "Validate This Idea" button with loading spinner + disabled state during request. Auth via window.Clerk. Error handling for rate limits, network errors, auth failures
- feat: `ValidationResult.tsx` — SWOT grid display with confidence score circle (color-coded), 4 quadrant boxes (Strengths/Weaknesses/Opportunities/Threats), matched signal count, "Build This Weekend" next step (Pro), free tier shows Strengths only + blur + upgrade CTA
- feat: `validate.astro` — new /validate page
- feat: `IdeaCard.tsx` — wired FrameworkAnalysis component into expanded detail, added frameworks + frameworks_teaser to Idea interface
- feat: nav updated with "Validate" link

**D1:**
- feat: migration 0009 — FTS5 virtual table `ideas_fts` for idea similarity matching (title + narrative_writeup), populated from existing 201 ideas, with INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE sync triggers
- feat: migration 0010 — `validations` table (user_id, idea_text, result_json, created_at) with user index

**Config:**
- feat: `wrangler.jsonc` — Durable Object binding (RATE_LIMITER, RateLimiterDO), new_sqlite_classes migration tag
- feat: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` set as Wrangler secret for real-time AI endpoints
- feat: `@anthropic-ai/sdk` added to Workers dependencies (typed client, automatic retries)
- chore: CLAUDE.md — added gstack skill routing rules
- chore: roadmap — moved Launch to dedicated milestone, Sprint 4 marked done

### 2026-03-31 — 64888d5: Trends dashboard fix + CI env var

- fix: trends route path mismatch — POST endpoint was `/api/trends/ingest/trends` (404), fixed to `/api/trends/ingest` by changing handler route from `/ingest/trends` to `/ingest` and updating pipeline URL derivation
- fix: pytrends returning 0 signals (Google 404 on trending endpoint) — added fallback in GET `/api/trends` that derives trend data from ideas table: source categories by volume + top product names by confidence/timing scores
- fix: added `PUBLIC_API_URL` env var to GitHub Actions CI build step — frontend API calls were hitting relative `/api` instead of `api.aideapulse.com` in Pages deployment

### 2026-03-31 — c605bf3: Clerk double-provider crash + export auth fix

- fix: Clerk ClerkProvider was double-mounting on pages with multiple React islands — HeaderAuth now wraps ClerkProvider internally, other components use `window.Clerk` global
- fix: export button in IdeaFeed was using `window.location.href` redirect (no auth header) — rewrote to fetch with Bearer token, create blob, trigger download via anchor click

### 2026-03-31 — 218cd50: Clerk publishable key in CI

- fix: `PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` was missing from GitHub Actions build — Clerk never loaded in Pages-deployed frontend (auth buttons invisible, dashboard blank)
- Added secret to GH Actions workflow env block

### 2026-03-30 — f048f11: Clerk SSR crash + Discourse tag fix

- fix: `HeaderAuth` used `client:load` which attempted SSR in Workers runtime, silently crashing and truncating all page HTML — switched to `client:only="react"` to skip SSR entirely
- fix: Discourse scraper returned tags as dicts (not strings) — pipeline crashed on `join()`. Now extracts tag name from dict objects.

### 2026-03-30 — 10ead57, 88847ac: GitHub Actions CI/CD

- chore: added GitHub Actions workflow for auto-deploying frontend to Cloudflare Pages on push to `main` (paths: `frontend/**`)
- chore: added `workflow_dispatch` trigger for manual frontend deploys

### 2026-03-30 — 5edf8d4: Sprint 5 — Match Ideabrowser Core

**Pipeline:**
- feat: `IdeaBrief` dataclass expanded with 5 new fields: `narrative_writeup`, `product_name`, `validation_playbook`, `gtm_strategy`, `scores` (dict with opportunity/pain_level/builder_confidence/timing), `community_signals` (list of signal dicts), `frameworks` (dict, Sprint 6 placeholder)
- feat: `ANALYSIS_PROMPT` rewritten — now requests product name, 3-4 paragraph business case, validation playbook, GTM strategy, and 4-dimension scores. `max_tokens` increased from 1500 to 3000.
- feat: `confidence_score` now computed as weighted composite: opportunity×0.30 + pain_level×0.25 + builder_confidence×0.25 + timing×0.20
- feat: all 12 signal formatters updated to return structured community signal dicts (source, title, URL, engagement metrics, excerpt) alongside text
- feat: `push_trends()` function added to push Google Trends data to `/api/trends/ingest`

**Workers (D1 + API):**
- feat: migration 0007 — ideas table recreation with 7 new columns (narrative_writeup, product_name, validation_playbook, gtm_strategy, scores_json, community_signals_json, frameworks_json) + expanded source_type CHECK for all 12 sources
- feat: migration 0008 — `keyword_trends` table (keyword, source, volume, growth_pct, related_topics_json, time_series_json, snapshot_date)
- feat: `ingest.ts` — IdeaPayload extended with 7 new fields, INSERT statement expanded to 22 bind params
- feat: `ideas.ts` — IdeaRow extended, `formatIdea()` parses new JSON columns, `teaserIdeaFields()` now includes product_name + signal_count
- feat: `trends.ts` (NEW) — POST `/api/trends/ingest` (HMAC-authenticated pipeline push), GET `/api/trends` (list keywords with volume/growth), GET `/api/trends/:keyword` (detail with time-series, Pro-gated)
- feat: `export.ts` (NEW) — GET `/api/export/ideas` (Pro-only JSON export with rate limiting: 10/day, scope=all|saved, Content-Disposition download header)

**Frontend:**
- feat: `ScoreBreakdown.tsx` (NEW) — 4 horizontal bar charts for opportunity/pain/builder/timing scores, color-coded (green >=80, amber >=50, gray <50)
- feat: `CommunitySignals.tsx` (NEW) — source signal cards with engagement metrics, source-specific accent colors, linked titles, excerpts
- feat: `TrendChart.tsx` (NEW) — pure SVG line chart (no dependencies), dark theme grid, cyan data line with area fill
- feat: `TrendsDashboard.tsx` (NEW) — keyword grid with volume + growth %, search bar, click-to-detail panel, Pro-gated time-series
- feat: `trends.astro` (NEW) — `/trends` page with TrendsDashboard component

- feat: `IdeaFeed.tsx` — Idea interface extended with Sprint 5 fields, Export button (Pro-only) in filter bar
- feat: `BaseLayout.astro` — "Trends" link added to navigation

**Content gating (Sprint 5):**
- Free: composite confidence score, product name (teaser), signal count

### 2026-03-29 — e453238: Expand pipeline from 8 to 12 sources
- feat: 4 new demand signal scrapers — Stack Exchange (REST API, 5 SE sites), GitHub Issues (search API, feature requests by reaction count), Discourse Forums (6 public instances: OpenAI, Fly.io, Netlify, Discourse Meta, Grafana, Elastic), PyPI/npm package trends (RSS + pypistats + npm registry)
- New prefilter functions: top 15 per source by engagement (SE score w/ unanswered boost, GH reactions, Discourse likes+replies, package downloads)
- Pipeline now produces ~726 additional raw signals per run, filtered to ~60 for Claude analysis
- Zero new dependencies or env vars required — all free APIs

- **Stripe live:** sandbox keys replaced with production keys across all three Wrangler secrets (STRIPE_SECRET_KEY, STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET, STRIPE_PRICE_ID). Live product: AIdeaPulse Pro (prod_UEQgecXm2DRu58), price: $12/mo (price_1TFxq1P3Smm2ZjICslGZI1Q7). Webhook endpoint at api.aideapulse.com/api/stripe/webhook listening for checkout.session.completed, customer.subscription.updated, customer.subscription.deleted.
- **Google OAuth published:** GCP OAuth consent screen exited Testing mode → In production. Branding page updated with home page, privacy policy (/privacy), and terms of service (/terms) URLs. No logo uploaded yet — users see "unverified app" warning until logo + verification submitted (cosmetic, not blocking).
- **Frontend redeployed:** privacy.astro and terms.astro (committed in cc4d8a8) now live on Cloudflare Pages.

### 2026-03-28 — 66da867: Apply D1 migrations in vitest test setup
- fix: integration tests in workers/test/health.test.ts failed because miniflare D1 had no tables
- added workers/test/setup.ts — applies full D1 schema via env.DB.batch() before tests run
- wired setup file into vitest.config.ts via setupFiles
- all 23 Workers tests now pass (7 fitScore + 11 ideas routes + 5 health/integration)

- fix: pipeline webhook URL updated from workers.dev to api.aideapulse.com in pipeline/.env
- ops: systemd timer rescheduled to 23:00 Central (DST-aware via TimezoneOfTimer), service timeout increased to 18000s (5 hours)

- fix: ProCheckout rewritten to use `window.Clerk` global instead of own ClerkProvider — eliminates duplicate ClerkProvider error on multi-island pages (9758e8a)
- verified: Stripe test checkout flow works — click "Upgrade to Pro" → Stripe checkout → webhook fires → D1 subscriptions table updated (plan: pro, status: active)
- verified: Google OAuth sign-in working via Clerk (Testing mode, test user configured)
- note: Google OAuth app still in Testing mode — needs privacy policy + terms pages before verification/publishing
- chore: old Google Client Secret (ending ****ruAM) disabled + deleted from GCP — only ****QTIz remains (active in Clerk)

### 2026-03-27 — 469ec31: Content gating — three-tier visibility (ADR-004)
